After an instance exists, there are no additional\nper-database or per-operation charges for use of the instance\n(though there may be additional network bandwidth charges).\nInstances offer isolation: problems with databases in one instance\nwill not affect other instances. However, within an instance\ndatabases can affect each other. For example, if one database in an\ninstance receives a lot of requests and consumes most of the\ninstance resources, fewer resources are available for other\ndatabases in that instance, and their performance may suffer.</p>","source":"google-cloud-spanner/lib/google/cloud/spanner/admin/instance/v1.rb#L130","resources":[],"examples":[],"params":[{"name":"credentials","types":["Google::Auth::Credentials","String","Hash","GRPC::Core::Channel","GRPC::Core::ChannelCredentials","Proc"],"description":"Provides the means for authenticating requests made by the client.
