Instances are dedicated Cloud Spanner serving\nand storage resources to be used by Cloud Spanner databases.</p>\n\n<p>Each instance has a “configuration”, which dictates where the\nserving resources for the Cloud Spanner instance are located (e.g.,\nUS-central, Europe).

After an instance exists, there are no additional\nper-database or per-operation charges for use of the instance\n(though there may be additional network bandwidth charges).\nInstances offer isolation: problems with databases in one instance\nwill not affect other instances. However, within an instance\ndatabases can affect each other. For example, if one database in an\ninstance receives a lot of requests and consumes most of the\ninstance resources, fewer resources are available for other\ndatabases in that instance, and their performance may suffer.</p>","source":"google-cloud-spanner/lib/google/cloud/spanner/admin/instance/v1/instance_admin_client.rb#L64","resources":[],"examples":[],"methods":[{"id":"instance_admin_stub-instance","type":"instance","name":"instance_admin_stub","title":["Google","Cloud","Spanner","Admin","Instance","V1","InstanceAdminClient#instance_admin_stub"],"description":"","source":"google-cloud-spanner/lib/google/cloud/spanner/admin/instance/v1/instance_admin_client.rb#L64","resources":[],"examples":[],"params":[],"exceptions":[],"returns":[{"types":["Google::Spanner::Admin::Instance::V1::InstanceAdmin::Stub"],"description":""}]},{"id":"project_path-class","type":"class","name":"project_path","title":["Google","Cloud","Spanner","Admin","Instance","V1","InstanceAdminClient.project_path"],"description":"<p>Returns
