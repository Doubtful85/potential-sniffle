Instances are dedicated Cloud Spanner serving\nand storage resources to be used by Cloud Spanner databases.</p>\n\n<p>Each instance has a “configuration”, which dictates where the\nserving resources for the Cloud Spanner instance are located (e.g.,\nUS-central, Europe). Configurations are created by Google based on\nresource availability.</p>\n\n<p>Cloud Spanner billing is based on the instances that exist and their\nsizes. After an instance exists, there are no additional\nper-database or per-operation charges for use of the instance\n(though there may be additional network bandwidth charges).\nInstances offer isolation: problems with databases in one instance\nwill not affect other instances. However, within an instance\ndatabases can affect each other. For example, if one database in an\ninstance receives a lot of requests and consumes most of the\ninstance resources, fewer resources are available for other\ndatabases in that instance, and their performance may suffer.</p>","source":"google-cloud-spanner/lib/google/cloud/spanner/admin/instance.rb#L111","resources":[],"examples":[],"params":[{"name":"version","types":["Symbol","String"],"description":"The major version of the service to be used.
