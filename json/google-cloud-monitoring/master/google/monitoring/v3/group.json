{"id":"google/monitoring/v3/group","name":"Group","title":["Google","Monitoring","V3","Group"],"description":"<p>The description of a dynamic collection of monitored resources. Each group\nhas a filter that is matched against monitored resources and their associated\nmetadata. If a group’s filter matches an available monitored resource, then\nthat resource is a member of that group.  Groups can contain any number of\nmonitored resources, and each monitored resource can be a member of any\nnumber of groups.</p>\n\n<p>Groups can be nested in parent-child hierarchies. The +parentName+ field\nidentifies an optional parent for each group.  If a group has a parent, then\nthe only monitored resources available to be matched by the group’s filter\nare the resources contained in the parent group.  In other words, a group\ncontains the monitored resources that match its filter and the filters of all\nthe group’s ancestors.  A group without a parent can contain any monitored\nresource.</p>\n\n<p>For example, consider an infrastructure running a set of instances with two\nuser-defined tags: +”environment”+ and +”role”+. A parent group has a filter,\n+environment=”production”+.  A child of that parent group has a filter,\n+role=”transcoder”+.  The parent group contains all instances in the\nproduction environment, regardless of their roles.  The child group contains\ninstances that have the transcoder role <em>and</em> are in the production\nenvironment.</p>\n\n<p>The monitored resources contained in a group can change at any moment,\ndepending on what resources exist and what filters are associated with the\ngroup and its ancestors.</p>","source":"google-cloud-monitoring/lib/google/cloud/monitoring/v3/doc/google/monitoring/v3/group.rb#L66","resources":[],"examples":[],"methods":[{"id":"name-instance","type":"instance","name":"name","title":["Google","Monitoring","V3","Group#name"],"description":"","source":"google-cloud-monitoring/lib/google/cloud/monitoring/v3/doc/google/monitoring/v3/group.rb#L66","resources":[],"examples":[],"params":[],"exceptions":[],"returns":[{"types":["String"],"description":"Output only.
