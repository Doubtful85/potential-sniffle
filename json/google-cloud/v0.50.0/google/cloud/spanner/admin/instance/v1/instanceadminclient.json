However, within an instance\ndatabases can affect each other. For example, if one database in an\ninstance receives a lot of requests and consumes most of the\ninstance resources, fewer resources are available for other\ndatabases in that instance, and their performance may suffer.</p>","source":"google-cloud-spanner/lib/google/cloud/spanner/admin/instance/v1/instance_admin_client.rb#L65","resources":[],"examples":[],"methods":[{"id":"instance_admin_stub-instance","type":"instance","name":"instance_admin_stub","title":["Google","Cloud","Spanner","Admin","Instance","V1","InstanceAdminClient#instance_admin_stub"],"description":"","source":"google-cloud-spanner/lib/google/cloud/spanner/admin/instance/v1/instance_admin_client.rb#L65","resources":[],"examples":[],"params":[],"exceptions":[],"returns":[{"types":["Google::Spanner::Admin::Instance::V1::InstanceAdmin::Stub"],"description":""}]},{"id":"project_path-class","type":"class","name":"project_path","title":["Google","Cloud","Spanner","Admin","Instance","V1","InstanceAdminClient.project_path"],"description":"<p>Returns a fully-qualified project resource name string.</p>","source":"google-cloud-spanner/lib/google/cloud/spanner/admin/instance/v1/instance_admin_client.rb#L121","resources":[],"examples":[],"params":[{"name":"project","types":["String"],"description":"","optional":false,"nullable":false}],"exceptions":[],"returns":[{"types":["String"],"description":""}]},{"id":"instance_config_path-class","type":"class","name":"instance_config_path","title":["Google","Cloud","Spanner","Admin","Instance","V1","InstanceAdminClient.instance_config_path"],"description":"<p>Returns a fully-qualified instance_config resource name string.</p>","source":"google-cloud-spanner/lib/google/cloud/spanner/admin/instance/v1/instance_admin_client.rb#L131","resources":[],"examples":[],"params":[{"name":"project","types":["String"],"description":"","optional":false,"nullable":false},{"name":"instance_config","types":["String"],"description":"","optional":false,"nullable":false}],"exceptions":[],"returns":[{"types":["String"],"description":""}]},{"id":"instance_path-class","type":"class","name":"instance_path","title":["Google","Cloud","Spanner","Admin","Instance","V1","InstanceAdminClient.instance_path"],"description":"<p>Returns a fully-qualified instance resource name string.</p>","source":"google-cloud-spanner/lib/google/cloud/spanner/admin/instance/v1/instance_admin_client.rb#L142","resources":[],"examples":[],"params":[{"name":"project","types":["String"],"description":"","optional":false,"nullable":false},{"name":"instance","types":["String"],"description":"","optional":false,"nullable":false}],"exceptions":[],"returns":[{"types":["String"],"description":""}]},{"id":"initialize-constructor","type":"constructor","name":"initialize","title":["Google","Cloud","Spanner","Admin","Instance","V1","InstanceAdminClient#initialize"],"description":"","source":"google-cloud-spanner/lib/google/cloud/spanner/admin/instance/v1/instance_admin_client.rb#L173","resources":[],"examples":[],"params":[{"name":"credentials","types":["Google::Auth::Credentials","String","Hash","GRPC::Core::Channel","GRPC::Core::ChannelCredentials","Proc"],"description":"Provides the means for authenticating requests made by the client.
