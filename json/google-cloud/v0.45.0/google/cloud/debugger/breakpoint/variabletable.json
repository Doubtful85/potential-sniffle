It enables storing a variable once and reference\nit from multiple variables, including variables stored in the\nvariable_table itself. For example, the same this object, which may\nappear at many levels of the stack, can have all of its data stored\nonce in this table. The stack frame variables then would hold only a\nreference to it.</p>\n\n<p>The variable var_table_index field is an index into this repeated\nfield. The stored objects are nameless and get their name from the\nreferencing variable. The effective variable is a merge of the\nreferencing variable and the referenced variable.</p>\n\n<p>See also <a data-custom-type=\"google/cloud/debugger/breakpoint\" data-method=\"variable_table-instance\">Breakpoint#variable_table</a>.</p>","source":"google-cloud-debugger/lib/google/cloud/debugger/breakpoint/variable_table.rb#L40","resources":[],"examples":[],"methods":[]}
