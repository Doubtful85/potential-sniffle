{"id":"google/cloud/storage/policy","name":"Policy","title":["Google","Cloud","Storage","Policy"],"description":"<h1 id=\"policy\">Policy</h1>\n\n<p>Represents a Cloud IAM Policy for the Cloud Storage service.</p>\n\n<p>A common pattern for updating a resourceâ€™s metadata, such as its Policy,\nis to read the current data from the service, update the data locally,\nand then send the modified data for writing. This pattern may result in\na conflict if two or more processes attempt the sequence simultaneously.\nIAM solves this problem with the\nGoogle::Cloud::Storage::Policy#etag property, which is used to\nverify whether the policy has changed since the last request. When you\nmake a request to with an <code>etag</code> value, Cloud IAM compares the <code>etag</code>\nvalue in the request with the existing <code>etag</code> value associated with the\npolicy. It writes the policy only if the <code>etag</code> values match.</p>\n\n<p>When you update a policy, first read the policy (and its current <code>etag</code>)\nfrom the service, then modify the policy locally, and then write the\nmodified policy to the service.
