The accuracy of the speech\nrecognition can be reduced if lossy codecs are used to capture or transmit\naudio, particularly if background noise is present.

You can request recognition for +WAV+ files that\ncontain either +LINEAR16+ or +MULAW+ encoded audio.\nIf you send +FLAC+ or +WAV+ audio file format in\nyour request, you do not need to specify an +AudioEncoding+; the audio\nencoding format is determined from the file header.
