This pattern may result in\na conflict if two or more processes attempt the sequence simultaneously.\nIAM solves this problem with the\nGoogle::Cloud::ResourceManager::Policy#etag property, which is used to\nverify whether the policy has changed since the last request. When you\nmake a request to with an <code>etag</code> value, Cloud IAM compares the <code>etag</code>\nvalue in the request with the existing <code>etag</code> value associated with the\npolicy. It writes the policy only if the <code>etag</code> values match.</p>\n\n<p>When you update a policy, first read the policy (and its current <code>etag</code>)\nfrom the service, then modify the policy locally, and then write the\nmodified policy to the service.
