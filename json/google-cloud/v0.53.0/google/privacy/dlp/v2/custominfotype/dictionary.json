This can\nbe used to match sensitive information specific to the data, such as a list\nof employee IDs or job titles.</p>\n\n<p>Dictionary words are case-insensitive and all characters other than letters\nand digits in the unicode <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_%28Unicode%29#Basic_Multilingual_Plane\">Basic Multilingual\nPlane</a>\nwill be replaced with whitespace when scanning for matches, so the\ndictionary phrase “Sam Johnson” will match all three phrases “sam johnson”,\n“Sam, Johnson”, and “Sam (Johnson)”. Additionally, the characters\nsurrounding any match must be of a different type than the adjacent\ncharacters within the word, so letters must be next to non-letters and\ndigits next to non-digits. For example, the dictionary word “jen” will\nmatch the first three letters of the text “jen123” but will return no\nmatches for “jennifer”.</p>\n\n<p>Dictionary words containing a large number of characters that are not\nletters or digits may result in unexpected findings because such characters\nare treated as whitespace.</p>","source":"google-cloud-dlp/lib/google/cloud/dlp/v2/doc/google/privacy/dlp/v2/storage.rb#L77","resources":[],"examples":[],"methods":[{"id":"word_list-instance","type":"instance","name":"word_list","title":["Google","Privacy","Dlp","V2","CustomInfoType","Dictionary#word_list"],"description":"","source":"google-cloud-dlp/lib/google/cloud/dlp/v2/doc/google/privacy/dlp/v2/storage.rb#L77","resources":[],"examples":[],"params":[],"exceptions":[],"returns":[{"types":["<a data-custom-type=\"google/privacy/dlp/v2/custominfotype/dictionary/wordlist\">Google::Privacy::Dlp::V2::CustomInfoType::Dictionary::WordList</a>"],"description":"List of words or phrases to search for."}]},{"id":"word_list=-instance","type":"instance","name":"word_list=","title":["Google","Privacy","Dlp","V2","CustomInfoType","Dictionary#word_list="],"description":"","source":"google-cloud-dlp/lib/google/cloud/dlp/v2/doc/google/privacy/dlp/v2/storage.rb#L77","resources":[],"examples":[],"params":[],"exceptions":[],"returns":[{"types":["<a data-custom-type=\"google/privacy/dlp/v2/custominfotype/dictionary/wordlist\">Google::Privacy::Dlp::V2::CustomInfoType::Dictionary::WordList</a>"],"description":"List of words or phrases to search for."}]},{"id":"cloud_storage_path-instance","type":"instance","name":"cloud_storage_path","title":["Google","Privacy","Dlp","V2","CustomInfoType","Dictionary#cloud_storage_path"],"description":"","source":"google-cloud-dlp/lib/google/cloud/dlp/v2/doc/google/privacy/dlp/v2/storage.rb#L77","resources":[],"examples":[],"params":[],"exceptions":[],"returns":[{"types":["<a data-custom-type=\"google/privacy/dlp/v2/cloudstoragepath\">Google::Privacy::Dlp::V2::CloudStoragePath</a>"],"description":"Newline-delimited file of words in Cloud Storage.
